For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.WHAT IS DATA :

Data is the collection of different numbers, symbols, and alphabets to represent information.

WHAT IS DATA STRUCTURE :

A data structure is a group of data elements that provides the easiest way to store and perform different actions on the data of the computer. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. 

The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure.

A data structure has also defined an instance of ADT.ADT means ABSTRACT DATA TYPE.

  <u>Linear Data Structure:</u><br>

 Elements are arranged in one dimension .also known as linear dimension.
 Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.<br><br>
   <u>Non-Linear Data Structure:</u><br>

  Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one, many-many dimensions.
 Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
